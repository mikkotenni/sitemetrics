# Site Metrics

I was not able to instal or run Design System in my environment. Therefore Design System components are utilized in as meaningful manner as I was able to by just looking at the source code.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
